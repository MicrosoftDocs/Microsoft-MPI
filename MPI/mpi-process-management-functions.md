# MPI Process Management Functions

## In this section

  - [**MPI\_Close\_port**](mpi-close-port-function.md)  
    Closes the port.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_accept**](mpi-comm-accept-function.md)  
    Accepts a request to form a new intercommunicator.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_connect**](mpi-comm-connect-function.md)  
    Make a request to form a new intercommunicator.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_disconnect**](mpi-comm-disconnect-function.md)  
    Disconnect from a communicator.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_get\_parent**](mpi-comm-get-parent-function.md)  
    Returns the parent communicator for this process.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_join**](mpi-comm-join-function.md)  
    Creates a communicator by joining two processes connected by a socket.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_spawn**](mpi-comm-spawn-function.md)  
    Spawns up to maxprocs instances of a single MPI application.

  - [**MPI\_Comm\_spawn\_multiple**](mpi-comm-spawn-multiple-function.md)  
    Spawns multiple binaries or the same binary with multiple sets of arguments, establishing communication with them and placing them in the same **MPI\_COMM\_WORLD**.

  - [**MPI\_Lookup\_name**](mpi-lookup-name-function.md)  
    Looks up a port given a service name.

  - [**MPI\_Open\_port**](mpi-open-port-function.md)  
    Establishes an address that can be used to establish connections between groups of MPI processes.

  - [**MPI\_Publish\_name**](mpi-publish-name-function.md)  
    Publishes a service name for use with [**MPI\_Comm\_connect**](mpi-comm-connect-function.md).

  - [**MPI\_Unpublish\_name**](mpi-unpublish-name-function.md)  
    Unpublish a service name, that was previously published with [**MPI\_Publish\_name**](mpi-publish-name-function.md).
