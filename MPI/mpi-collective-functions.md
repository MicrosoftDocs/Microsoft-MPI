# MPI Collective Functions

## In this section

  - [**MPI\_Allgather**](mpi-allgather-function.md)  
    Gathers data from all members of a group and sends the data to all members of the group.

  - [**MPI\_Allgatherv**](mpi-allgatherv-function.md)  
    Gathers a variable amount of data from each member of a group and sends the data to all members of the group.

  - [**MPI\_Allreduce**](mpi-allreduce-function.md)  
    Combines values from all processes and distributes the result back to all processes.

  - [**MPI\_Alltoall**](mpi-alltoall-function.md)  
    Gathers data from and scatters data to all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Alltoallv**](mpi-alltoallv-function.md)  
    Gathers data from and scatters data to all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Alltoallw**](mpi-alltoallw-function.md)  
    Gathers data from and scatters data to all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Barrier**](mpi-barrier-function.md)  
    Initiates barrier synchronization across all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Bcast**](mpi-bcast-function.md)  
    Broadcasts data from one member of a group to all members of the group.

  - [**MPI\_Gather**](mpi-gather-function.md)  
    Gathers data from all members of a group to one member.

  - [**MPI\_Gatherv**](mpi-gatherv-function.md)  
    Gathers variable data from all members of a group to one member.

  - [**MPI\_Iallgather**](mpi-iallgather-function.md)  
    Gathers data from all members of a group and sends the data to all members of the group in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Iallreduce**](mpi-iallreduce-function.md)  
    Combines values from all processes and distributes the result back to all processes in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Ibarrier**](mpi-ibarrier-function.md)  
    Performs a barrier synchronization across all members of a group in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Ibcast**](mpi-ibcast-function.md)  
    Broadcasts a message from the process with rank "root" to all other processes of the communicator in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Igather**](mpi-igather-function.md)  
    Gathers data from all members of a group to one member in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Igatherv**](mpi-igatherv-function.md)  
    Gathers variable data from all members of a group to one member in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Ireduce**](mpi-ireduce-function.md)  
    Performs a global reduce operation (for example sum, maximum, or logical and) across all members of a group in a non-blocking way.

  - [**MPI\_Iscatter**](mpi-iscatter-function.md)  
    Scatters data from one member across all members of a group in a non-blocking way. This function performs the inverse of the operation that is performed by the [**MPI\_Igather**](mpi-igather-function.md)function.

  - [**MPI\_Iscatterv**](mpi-iscatterv-function.md)  
    [**MPI\_Reduce**](mpi-reduce-function.md)  
    Performs a global reduce operation across all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Scatter**](mpi-scatter-function.md)  
    Scatters data from one member across all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Scatterv**](mpi-scatterv-function.md)  
    Scatters data from one member across all members of a group.

  - [**MPI\_Exscan**](mpi-exscan-function.md)  
    Computes the exclusive scan (partial reductions) of data on a collection of processes.

  - [**MPI\_Op\_create**](mpi-op-create-function.md)  
    Creates a user-defined combination function handle.

  - [**MPI\_Op\_free**](mpi-op-free-function.md)  
    Frees a user-defined combination function handle.

  - [**MPI\_Reduce\_local**](mpi-reduce-local-function.md)  
    Applies a reduction operator to local arguments.

  - [**MPI\_Reduce\_scatter**](mpi-reduce-scatter-function.md)  
    Combines values and scatters the results.

  - [**MPI\_Scan**](mpi-scan-function.md)  
    Computes the scan (partial reductions) of data on a collection of processes.

  - [**MPI\_User\_function**](mpi-user-function-function.md)  
    [**MPI\_User\_function**](mpi-user-function-function.md) is a placeholder for the application-defined function name.
