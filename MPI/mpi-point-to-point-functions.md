# MPI Point to Point Functions

## In this section

  - [**MPI\_Bsend**](mpi-bsend-function.md)  
    Sends data to a specified process in buffered mode.

  - [**MPI\_Bsend\_init**](mpi-bsend-init-function.md)  
    Builds a handle for a buffered send.

  - [**MPI\_Cancel**](mpi-cancel-function.md)  
    Cancels a communication request.

  - [**MPI\_Get\_count**](mpi-get-count-function.md)  
    Gets the number of "top level" elements.

  - [**MPI\_Ibsend**](mpi-ibsend-function.md)  
    Initiates a buffered mode send operation and returns a handle to the communication operation.

  - [**MPI\_Iprobe**](mpi-iprobe-function.md)  
    Nonblocking test for a message.

  - [**MPI\_Improbe**](mpi-improbe-function.md)  
    Probes for a message in a non-blocking way. Provides a mechanism to receive the specific message that was matched regardless of intervening probe/receive operations. The matched message is de-queued off the receive queue, giving the application an opportunity to decide how to receive the message based on the information returned by the non-blocking matching probe operation. The matched message is then received using the [**MPI\_Mrecv**](mpi-mrecv-function.md) or [**MPI\_Imrecv**](mpi-imrecv-function.md) function.

  - [**MPI\_Imrecv**](mpi-imrecv-function.md)  
    Performs a non-blocking receive for a message matched by [**MPI\_Mprobe**](mpi-mprobe-function.md) or [**MPI\_Improbe**](mpi-improbe-function.md).

  - [**MPI\_Irecv**](mpi-irecv-function.md)  
    Initiates a receive operation and returns a handle to the requested communication operation.

  - [**MPI\_Irsend**](mpi-irsend-function.md)  
    Initiates a ready mode send operation and returns a request handle that represents the communication operation.

  - [**MPI\_Isend**](mpi-isend-function.md)  
    Initiates a standard mode send operation and returns a handle to the requested communication operation.

  - [**MPI\_Issend**](mpi-issend-function.md)  
    Initiates a synchronous mode send operation and returns a handle to the requested communication operation.

  - [**MPI\_Mprobe**](mpi-mprobe-function.md)  
    Blocking probes for a message. Provides a mechanism to receive the specific message that was matched regardless of intervening probe/receive operations. The matched message is de-queued off the receive queue, giving the application an opportunity to decide how to receive the message based on the information returned by the matching probe operation. The matched message is then received using the [**MPI\_Mrecv**](mpi-mrecv-function.md) or [**MPI\_Imrecv**](mpi-imrecv-function.md) function.

  - [**MPI\_Mrecv**](mpi-mrecv-function.md)  
    Performs a blocking receive for a message matched by [**MPI\_Mprobe**](mpi-mprobe-function.md) or [**MPI\_Improbe**](mpi-improbe-function.md).

  - [**MPI\_Probe**](mpi-probe-function.md)  
    Blocking test for a message.

  - [**MPI\_Recv**](mpi-recv-function.md)  
    Performs a receive operation and does not return until a matching message is received.

  - [**MPI\_Recv\_init**](mpi-recv-init-function.md)  
    Create a persistent request for a receive.

  - [**MPI\_Request\_free**](mpi-request-free-function.md)  
    Frees a communication request object.

  - [**MPI\_Request\_get\_status**](mpi-request-get-status-function.md)  
    Nondestructive test for the completion of a request.

  - [**MPI\_Rsend**](mpi-rsend-function.md)  
    Performs a ready mode send operation and returns when the send buffer can be safely reused.

  - [**MPI\_Rsend\_init**](mpi-rsend-init-function.md)  
    Creates a persistent request for a ready send.

  - [**MPI\_Send**](mpi-send-function.md)  
    Performs a standard mode send operation and returns when the send buffer can be safely reused.

  - [**MPI\_Send\_init**](mpi-send-init-function.md)  
    Creates a persistent request for a standard send.

  - [**MPI\_Sendrecv**](mpi-sendrecv-function.md)  
    Sends and receives a message.

  - [**MPI\_Sendrecv\_replace**](mpi-sendrecv-replace-function.md)  
    Sends and receives using a single buffer.

  - [**MPI\_Ssend**](mpi-ssend-function.md)  
    Performs a synchronous mode send operation and returns when the send buffer can be safely reused.

  - [**MPI\_Ssend\_init**](mpi-ssend-init-function.md)  
    Creates a persistent request for a synchronous send.

  - [**MPI\_Start**](mpi-start-function.md)  
    Initiates a communication with a persistent request handle.

  - [**MPI\_Startall**](mpi-startall-function.md)  
    Starts a collection of persistent requests.

  - [**MPI\_Test**](mpi-test-function.md)  
    Tests an outstanding operation for completion.

  - [**MPI\_Test\_cancelled**](mpi-test-cancelled-function.md)  
    Tests to see if a request was cancelled.

  - [**MPI\_Testall**](mpi-testall-function.md)  
    Tests for the completion of all previously initiated requests.

  - [**MPI\_Testany**](mpi-testany-function.md)  
    Tests for completion of any previdously initiated requests.

  - [**MPI\_Testsome**](mpi-testsome-function.md)  
    Tests for completion of some of previously initiated requests.

  - [**MPI\_Wait**](mpi-wait-function.md)  
    Completes an outstanding operation.

  - [**MPI\_Waitall**](mpi-waitall-function.md)  
    Completes multiple outstanding operations.

  - [**MPI\_Waitany**](mpi-waitany-function.md)  
    Completes one out of several outstanding operations.

  - [**MPI\_Waitsome**](mpi-waitsome-function.md)  
    Waits for some of given MPI requests to complete.

  - [**MSMPI\_Queuelock\_acquire**](msmpi-queuelock-acquire-function.md)  
    Acquires the Microsoft MPI library global lock.

  - [**MSMPI\_Queuelock\_release**](msmpi-queuelock-release-function.md)  
    Releases the Microsoft MPI library global lock.

  - [**MSMPI\_Waitsome\_interruptible**](msmpi-waitsome-interruptible-function.md)  
    Waits until at least one of the operations that is associated with active handles in the list has finished, or the call is interrupted by another thread that calls [**MSMPI\_Queuelock\_acquire**](msmpi-queuelock-acquire-function.md).
